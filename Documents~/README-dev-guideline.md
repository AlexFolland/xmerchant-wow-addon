How to release / publish a new package (or say, build / version) onto CurseForge:
* Create and push git tag, with tag name containing keywords of "`alpha`/`beta`/`release`". Examples:
    * `1.9.1-alpha` as alpha test version
    * `1.9.1-release` as public release version
    * `1.9.5-release-classic` as public release version, for classic WoW.
    * `1.9.6-beta-wotlk` as alpha test version, for classic WoTLK WoW.
    * `1.10.0-release` as public release version, for latest mainline WoW.
* See ref: [Automatic Packaging: CurseForge support](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000197281-automatic-packaging)
* See ref: [Multi-TOC for World of Warcraft Addons: CurseForge support](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000209856-multi-toc-for-world-of-warcraft-addons)
* Changelog of a released package can be edited (and enabling markdown) at: [xmerchant files](https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/xmerchant/files) (maybe developer permission required on curseforge)
